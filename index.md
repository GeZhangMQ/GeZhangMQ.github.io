I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at School of Computing, Macquarie University, advised by Dr. [Jia Wu](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~jiawu/) and Prof. [Jian Yang](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~jian/). My research mainly focus on graph mining and anomaly detection. I finished my Master's at College of Intelligence and Computing, Tinajin University. <cr>
